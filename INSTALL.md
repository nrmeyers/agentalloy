## What this installs

A local **AgentAlloy** service that gives your coding agent (this LLM, or another) access to a curated corpus of engineering skills — testing patterns, error handling, deployment recipes, observability, security, etc. — composed dynamically per task.

The runtime is a small FastAPI service backed by:
- An embedding model (`qwen3-embedding:0.6b`, 1024-dim) — runs on any hardware via Ollama or LM Studio
- A skill corpus split into **packs** that the user opts into at install time (default: 5 always-on packs — `core`, `engineering`, `documentation`, `performance`, `refactoring`; opt-in: `nodejs`, `typescript`, `nestjs`, `react`, `vue`, `agents`, `auth`, `observability`, etc.). Pack source YAMLs ship in the wheel; the binary corpus (LadybugDB + DuckDB) is generated locally on first install.
- Your handoff harness (Claude Code / Cursor / Continue.dev / etc.) — wired so it can query the API

**AgentAlloy is user-scoped, not per-repo.** You install once; every project the user opens can wire to the same service. State lives at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/agentalloy/`; corpus at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/agentalloy/corpus/`. Repos contain only sentinel-bounded blocks injected into agent config files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/agentalloy.mdc`, etc.).

Total install time: usually 3–5 minutes on a warm machine.

## TL;DR

Most users want exactly this:

```bash
# One-time: install uv if needed (Linux / macOS)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install the CLI into PATH so it works from any directory.
uv tool install git+https://github.com/nrmeyers/agentalloy.git

# Once per machine — installs everything user-scoped.
# Will prompt: "Do you want agentalloy to run persistently as a background service?"
agentalloy setup

# Once per repo — wire this project to the service. Auto-detects the harness.
cd ~/dev/some-project && agentalloy wire

# If you chose manual mode during setup, start the service now:
agentalloy serve
```

If you want to walk the user through this carefully (recommended for first install on the machine), the rest of this runbook drills into each step the LLM should take.

---

## Prerequisites

You need:
- **Python 3.12+** with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed
- A network connection (for model downloads — the corpus is already in the wheel)
- One of the supported handoff harnesses installed (we'll ask which one in step 5)

The runbook itself runs `agentalloy preflight` (Step 0 below) to verify these. **Never bypass a failed preflight check** — every later step assumes the prereqs are met, and skipping a fatal failure here is what causes the LLM to hand-roll workarounds (`~/.local/bin/agentalloy install-packs --list` etc.) midstream.

For missing binaries (`uv`, `ollama`), **stop and ask the user to install them**. Do not auto-execute install scripts — that's a non-reversible action that requires the human in the loop. Install commands:

- **uv:** see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
- **Ollama (Linux):** `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
- **Ollama (macOS):** `brew install ollama`, or https://ollama.com/download/mac
- **Ollama (Windows / other):** see https://ollama.com/download

After installing Ollama, the user must have `ollama serve` running (the official installer sets this up as a service on macOS/Windows; on Linux the install script registers a systemd unit). Step 0's runner-phase preflight confirms reachability.

> **Ollama SSH key authentication:** If your Ollama instance requires SSH key authentication
> (common when `OLLAMA_HOST` is set to a remote instance, or when SSH auth is enabled on a
> local instance), you must have an ed25519 key at `~/.ollama/id_ed25519` before pulling
> models. Ollama 0.20.3+ looks for the key at this path (not `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
>
> - **Check if auth is required:** Run `ollama list`. If it succeeds without a key, your
>   instance does not require auth. If it fails with
>   `pull model manifest: open ~/.ollama/id_ed25519: no such file or directory`, you need
>   to set up a key.
> - **Generate a key:** `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ollama/id_ed25519 -N ""`
> - **Register the public key:** Copy the contents of `~/.ollama/id_ed25519.pub` to the
>   Ollama server's `~/.ollama/server_user.pub` (or the equivalent auth config for your setup).
> - **Remote Ollama:** If `OLLAMA_HOST` points to a remote instance, the public key must be
>   registered on that remote server's Ollama configuration.

---

## Step 0: Preflight (run this first, every time)

> RUN
> ```bash
> uv run python -m agentalloy.install preflight
> ```

This runs the host-agnostic checks: Python ≥ 3.12, `uv` present, `agentalloy` resolvable on PATH (i.e. `~/.local/bin` is in `$PATH`), XDG dirs writable, network reachable, default port `47950` free.

> CONFIRM
>
> If `preflight` exits non-zero, the JSON output lists `fatal_failures` and a `remediation` line for each. **Surface every fatal remediation to the user verbatim and STOP.** Do not run `agentalloy setup`, do not move on to Step 1, and do not invent workarounds. Once the user has applied the fixes, re-run Step 0 until it exits 0.

If `cli_on_path` fails before Step 1b has run, that's expected — Step 1b installs the CLI. Run Step 1 + Step 1b first, then re-run Step 0 to confirm `cli_on_path` now passes.

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight

> RUN
> ```bash
> uv sync
> ```

This installs the agentalloy Python dependencies into a project-local `.venv`. Should take under 30 seconds on a warm cache.

If `uv sync` fails:
- Network issue → retry or check proxy settings
- Python version mismatch → `python --version` should be ≥ 3.12

---

## Step 1b: Install the CLI user-scoped

> RUN
> ```bash
> uv tool install git+https://github.com/nrmeyers/agentalloy.git
> ```

This installs the `agentalloy` command into the user's PATH (at `~/.local/bin/agentalloy` or equivalent) so it works from any directory — not just from inside this repo. Required so `agentalloy wire`, `agentalloy serve`, and `agentalloy status` work after you `cd` into a project repo.

**Contributor note:** If you're developing agentalloy itself, install editable instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrmeyers/agentalloy.git
cd agentalloy
uv sync
uv tool install --editable .
```

Verify it landed by re-running preflight (which is the authoritative PATH check):

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy preflight
> ```

If `cli_on_path` still fails, the JSON `remediation` field gives the exact `export PATH=...` line to add. Surface it to the user verbatim and **STOP** until they confirm they've fixed their shell profile and `which agentalloy` resolves to `~/.local/bin/agentalloy`.

---

## Step 2: Hardware detection

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy detect
> ```

This emits a JSON document describing the hardware. Read it. The output is also written to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/agentalloy/outputs/detect.json` so subsequent steps can refer to it.

> CONFIRM
>
> Tell the user, in plain English, what was detected. For example:
> > "I detected a MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon (M3 Pro), 36 GB unified memory, macOS 14.5. No discrete GPU. Metal acceleration is available. Does that look right?"
>
> Wait for the user to confirm or correct. If they correct, replace the corresponding fields in your working memory and use the corrected values for subsequent steps.

---

## Step 3: Host target selection

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy recommend-host-targets --hardware ~/.local/share/agentalloy/outputs/detect.json
> ```

The output lists which host targets are available on this hardware. Exactly one will be flagged `recommended: true`.

> ASK
>
> Present the recommendation first, then list alternatives. For example:
> > "I recommend running the embedding model on the **iGPU** (Apple Metal), because it's faster than CPU and your Mac has it available. Alternatives: dGPU (not available on this hardware), or CPU+RAM (slower but works).
> >
> > Use the recommendation, or pick a different target?"
>
> Wait for an answer. Default to the recommendation if the user just hits enter.

---

## Step 4: Model variant selection

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy recommend-models --hardware ~/.local/share/agentalloy/outputs/detect.json --host <chosen-target>
> ```

The output lists `{embed_model, embed_runner}` options valid for the chosen host target, with one flagged `default: true`. The `preset` field tells you which `.env` preset will be used.

> ASK
>
> Most users want the default. For example:
> > "For Apple Silicon + iGPU, I'll use **qwen3-embedding:0.6b** via Ollama. Use this default, or pick a different runner?"
>
> Wait for confirmation.

---

## Step 5: Pull models

> **Pre-pull check:** If your Ollama instance requires SSH key authentication, verify the
> key exists before pulling:
>
> ```bash
> test -f ~/.ollama/id_ed25519 && echo "Key present" || echo "Key missing — see prerequisites"
> ```
>
> If the key is missing, generate it as described in the prerequisites section above.

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy pull-models --models ~/.local/share/agentalloy/outputs/recommend-models.json
> ```

The output may include `manual_steps_required` if the user picked a runner without auto-pull (LM Studio, MLX, vLLM). If so:

> CONFIRM
>
> Read the `manual_steps_required` instructions to the user verbatim. Wait for them to confirm they've completed those steps before proceeding.

If `recommend-models` ran non-interactively and defaulted to `ollama` but the user has `llama-server` installed, pass `--runner llama-server` to override:

```bash
agentalloy pull-models --models ~/.local/share/agentalloy/outputs/recommend-models.json --runner llama-server
```

---

## Step 6: Initialize the corpus directory

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy seed-corpus
> ```

This creates the user-scoped corpus directory at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/agentalloy/corpus/` and initializes empty LadybugDB + DuckDB stores. The wheel no longer ships pre-built skills — Step 8 below populates the corpus from packs the user picks.

---

## Step 7: Start the embedding server

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy start-embed-server --models ~/.local/share/agentalloy/outputs/recommend-models.json
> ```

This brings the embedding backend online before pack ingestion. What happens depends on the runner chosen in Step 4:

- **llama-server**: spawns `llama-server --embeddings --port 11436 --ubatch-size 2048` in the background and waits up to 120 seconds for the server to accept connections. The log is written to `~/.local/share/agentalloy/logs/embed-server.log`.
- **ollama**: fires `ollama serve` (idempotent — safe if already running) and polls port 11436.
- **lm-studio / other**: prints instructions for you to start the server manually. Start it before proceeding to Step 8.

The step is idempotent: if port 11436 is already listening it exits 0 immediately.

> CONFIRM
>
> Wait for this step to exit 0 before continuing. If it times out, check the log at `~/.local/share/agentalloy/logs/embed-server.log` for startup errors.

---

## Step 8: Pick and install skill packs

Run the interactive pack selection:

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy install-packs
> ```

The user is presented with a **tier-grouped pack listing** — packs are organized under labeled tiers (Foundation, Languages, Frameworks, Tooling, Workflows, Domain, Platform, Protocol, Store). Each pack shows its description and skill count. Always-on packs are marked with `[always-on]`.

Example output:

```
 Foundation:
   [1] core            [always-on] — 42 skills
   [2] documentation   [always-on] — 8 skills
   [3] engineering     [always-on] — 55 skills
   ...
 Languages:
   [4] nodejs          — 18 skills
   [5] typescript      — 15 skills
   [6] python          — 22 skills
   ...
 Frameworks:
   [7] fastapi         — 14 skills
   [8] react           — 12 skills
   ...
```

The prompt accepts:
- **Pack names** (comma-separated): `nodejs,typescript,fastapi`
- **Tier names**: `languages,frameworks` installs all packs in those tiers
- **`all`**: installs every pack
- **Blank**: installs only the always-on packs (`core`, `engineering`, `documentation`, `performance`, `refactoring`)

Always-on packs (`core`, `documentation`, `engineering`, `performance`, `refactoring`) are always included regardless of selection.

> ASK
>
> Tell the user:
> > "AgentAlloy's corpus is split into packs. You opt in to the ones that match your stack. Five packs install automatically (marked [always-on]): `core`, `engineering`, `documentation`, `performance`, `refactoring`. Pick any additional packs by name or tier — e.g. `nodejs,typescript` or `languages,frameworks`, or `all`. Leave blank for always-on only. You can always add more packs later with `agentalloy install-pack <name>`."

> Read the available packs from the CLI's interactive prompt. Wait for the user's selection.

The command ingests each chosen pack and runs one bulk re-embed pass at the end. **Expect 5–10 minutes** on a warm-cache iGPU for a moderate selection (e.g., core + engineering + nodejs + typescript = ~115 skills, ~700 fragments).

Non-interactive / scripted environments: pass `--packs <name1,name2,...>` (or `--packs all`) to skip the prompt. With no flag in non-TTY mode, only the always-on packs install. Unknown pack names in `--packs` cause the command to fail fast with the available pack list; pass `--ignore-unknown` to skip unrecognized names and continue with the known subset.

If the bulk re-embed fails partway (e.g., the embedding server crashes mid-run), the install state records what landed and the embed step is idempotent — just re-run `agentalloy reembed` to finish.

---

## Step 9: Write `.env`

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy write-env --preset <chosen-preset>
> ```

(Substitute the preset name from step 4's `preset` field, e.g., `apple-silicon`.) The `.env` is written to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/agentalloy/.env` with mode `0600` (owner read/write only).

If the user wants a non-default port (because 47950 is taken on their machine), pass `--port <n>`. Otherwise let it default to 47950.

---

## Step 10: Handoff harness selection

> ASK
>
> Ask the user which coding harness they're using. Read the list aloud:
> > "What harness will be calling the skill API?
> > 1. Claude Code
> > 2. Gemini CLI
> > 3. Cursor
> > 4. Continue.dev with a closed/cloud model (Anthropic, OpenAI)
> > 5. Continue.dev with a locally-hosted model
> > 6. OpenCode with a local LLM
> > 7. Aider with a local LLM
> > 8. Cline
> > 9. Other / I'll wire it manually
> > 10. I want the strict-tools MCP fallback for one of the above"
>
> Wait for the user's choice. Note: option 10 is a compound — if chosen, follow up with "which of options 1–8 should the MCP server be configured for?"

Record the harness choice. The CLI uses one of: `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `cursor`, `continue-closed`, `continue-local`, `opencode`, `aider`, `cline`, `manual`. For the strict-tools MCP fallback, pass `--mcp-fallback` with one of the supported harnesses (claude-code, cursor, continue-closed, continue-local).

---

## Step 11: Wire the harness

> RUN
> ```bash
> cd <user's repo> && agentalloy wire-harness --harness <chosen-harness>
> ```

(Substitute the harness key from step 10.) The shorter form is `agentalloy wire --harness <chosen>` — the verb auto-detects the harness from the cwd if you omit the flag.

**Auto-detection priority** (used when `--harness` is omitted; first match wins):
1. `.cursor/` or `.cursorrules` → `cursor`
2. `.continuerc.json` → `continue-local`
3. `.aider.conf.yml` → `aider`
4. `.opencode/` → `opencode`
5. `.clinerules` → `cline`
6. `GEMINI.md` → `gemini-cli`
7. `CLAUDE.md` → `claude-code`

A repo with multiple markers (e.g. both `.cursor/` and `CLAUDE.md`, common when more than one agent is wired to the project) will pick the higher-priority entry and print a `NOTE:` line so the user can pass `--harness <name>` to override. Tool-specific dotfiles outrank `CLAUDE.md` because the latter is shared by several agents and is a weaker signal.

The output lists which file(s) were modified and where the sentinel-bounded agentalloy block was injected. Tell the user:

> "I added a agentalloy integration block to **CLAUDE.md** in your project. The block is bounded by `<!-- BEGIN agentalloy install -->` / `<!-- END agentalloy install -->` markers — `agentalloy unwire` removes only what's between the markers, so your other content is safe.
>
> Repos are wired one-at-a-time. To wire another project, `cd` into it and run `agentalloy wire` again — AgentAlloy state is user-scoped, so you don't need to re-do steps 1–8."

If the user picked `manual`, the output includes copy-pasteable instructions for the user to apply themselves. Read those to the user.

---

## Step 12: Verify

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy verify
> ```

This runs 8 enumerated install-time checks (embedding endpoint reachable, returns 1024-dim, DuckDB present at the user-scope corpus dir, LadybugDB present, skill count meets minimum, harness config present, harness config URL matches, runtime port available).

When the service is running, the corpus checks (`duckdb_present`, `ladybug_present`, `skill_count_meets_minimum`) query `GET /diagnostics/runtime` instead of opening DB files directly — Kùzu's single-writer lock would otherwise make those checks fail spuriously while the service holds the corpus open. `runtime_port_available` accepts `"healthy"` (passes) and `"degraded"` (passes with warning) responses from `/health`.

If `all_checks_passed: true`, proceed to step 13.

If any check fails:
> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy doctor
> ```
>
> Read the doctor output to the user. Each failed check has an `error` and a `remediation`. Surface the remediation to the user and ask if they want to retry the failed step or get help.

---

## Step 13: Enable persistent service

> **Note:** If you ran `agentalloy setup`, this step was already prompted interactively as part of that command. Skip to Step 13 if `install-state.json` already contains a `service_mode` entry.

> ASK
> "Do you want AgentAlloy to start automatically in the background, or will you start it manually each session?
>  1. Persistent — native service (systemd on Linux / launchd on macOS, starts at login)
>  2. Persistent — container (single-container model, starts on demand)
>  3. Manual — I'll run `agentalloy serve` myself"

Then based on the answer:

> RUN
> ```bash
> # For native:
> agentalloy enable-service --mode native
>
> # For container:
> agentalloy enable-service --mode container
>
> # For manual:
> agentalloy enable-service --mode manual
> ```

The subcommand detects the available service manager (systemd/launchd) or container runtime (podman preferred, docker fallback), writes the appropriate unit/plist/startup invocation, starts the service, and polls `/health` for up to 30s to confirm startup. Container deployments pull a pre-built image from GHCR — the CI pipeline publishes two image variants on every merge to `main`: `ghcr.io/nrmeyers/agentalloy:latest` (~300 MB, lightweight) and `ghcr.io/nrmeyers/agentalloy:full` (~975 MB, with model pre-pulled for air-gapped environments). No repo checkout, no build context, and no `git` required. For air-gapped environments, use `--image-path` to deploy from a local tarball (produced via `podman save`). On success, the mode is recorded in `install-state.json`.

> **Container deployments pull a pre-built image from GHCR.** The CI pipeline builds and publishes two image variants on every merge to `main`:
>
> | Variant | Size | Model | Use case |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | `ghcr.io/nrmeyers/agentalloy:latest` | ~300 MB | Not included | General users with network access. The model is pulled at first container start. |
> | `ghcr.io/nrmeyers/agentalloy:full` | ~975 MB | Pre-pulled (`qwen3-embedding:0.6b`) | Air-gapped/enterprise environments that need the model baked into the image. |
>
> Select the variant with `--image-tag` during setup:
> ```bash
> # Lightweight (default) — model downloaded at first start
> agentalloy setup --deployment container
>
> # Full — model pre-pulled into the image
> agentalloy setup --deployment container --image-tag full
> ```
>
> Setup pulls the image directly — no repo checkout, no build context, and no `git` required. For air-gapped environments, use `--image-path` to deploy from a local tarball (produced via `podman save`).
>
> **SSH key authentication (container):** The container mounts the host's `~/.ollama` directory into `/root/.ollama` inside the container. If your Ollama instance requires SSH key authentication (see the prerequisites section), the same key at `~/.ollama/id_ed25519` on the host is automatically available to the container — no additional configuration needed. If the model pull fails with an SSH key error inside the container, fix the key on the host as described in the prerequisites.

---

## Step 14: Start the service + first-run demo

Start the service in foreground (recommended — same idiom as `ollama serve`):

> RUN
> ```bash
> agentalloy serve
> ```

This sources `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/agentalloy/.env` into the process environment, then execs `uvicorn agentalloy.app:app` on the configured port. **Leave it running** in the terminal; open a new shell for the demo curl.

Alternatively, the user can manually run `uv run uvicorn agentalloy.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 47950` from a terminal of their choice — `agentalloy serve` is just the convenience wrapper.

Wait 3 seconds for the service to start, then in another shell:

> RUN
> ```bash
> curl -s -X POST http://localhost:47950/compose \
>   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   -d '{"task": "write a failing pytest", "phase": "build"}'
> ```

Show the user the response. The `output` field contains concatenated raw skill fragments; `source_skills` lists which skills contributed. Tell the user:

> "The skill API is live. Returned guidance from these skills: [list]. The full text is what your harness will see when it queries this endpoint.
>
> **Try it now:** open your harness (Claude Code / Cursor / etc.) and ask: 'What skills do you have access to right now? Run `curl http://localhost:47950/health` to confirm.' If everything is wired correctly, your harness should respond with a list of skill capabilities pulled from the API."

---

## You're done

State summary:
- Service running at `http://localhost:<port>` (default 47950)
- Service mode recorded: `native` (systemd/launchd), `container` (podman/docker), or `manual` (`agentalloy serve`)
- Skill corpus seeded into `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/agentalloy/corpus/`
- Models pulled and on disk
- `.env` written to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/agentalloy/.env`
- This repo's harness wired with sentinel-bounded injection
- All 8 verify checks passed

**To wire another repo to the same service:** `cd ~/dev/other-project && agentalloy wire`. No re-detect, no re-pull, no re-seed needed — the user-scope install serves every repo on this machine.

**To check status across all wired repos:** `agentalloy status` shows the user state, which repos are wired, the corpus location, and whether the service is reachable.

Operator commands the user can run later (these are NOT part of this runbook — they're for reference):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `agentalloy status` | Show user state + wired repos + service reachability |
| `agentalloy serve` | Start the service in foreground (terminal must stay open) |
| `agentalloy wire` | Wire the current repo (cwd) to the service |
| `agentalloy unwire` | Remove sentinels from the current repo only (keeps user state, `.env`, and corpus) |
| `agentalloy doctor` | Runtime health check on demand |
| `agentalloy update` | Migrate corpus in place after a version bump |
| `agentalloy install-pack <name>` | Add a published skill pack to the user corpus |
| `agentalloy reset-step <name>` | Clear a specific install step (escape hatch for changing config without full uninstall) |
| `agentalloy uninstall` | Full teardown — see below for exactly what's removed |

### Container operational commands

For container deployments (`--deployment container`), use these commands to manage the running container:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `podman logs agentalloy` | View container logs (add `-f` to follow) |
| `podman logs --tail 100 agentalloy` | Last 100 lines of container logs |
| `podman inspect agentalloy` | Inspect container metadata and configuration |
| `podman ps --filter name=agentalloy` | Check if the container is running |
| `podman exec -it agentalloy sh` | Open an interactive shell inside the container |
| `podman restart agentalloy` | Restart the container |
| `podman stop agentalloy` | Stop the container (graceful shutdown) |
| `podman rm -f agentalloy` | Force-remove the container |
| `podman volume inspect agentalloy-data` | Inspect the persistent data volume |
| `curl http://localhost:47950/health` | Check the service health endpoint |
| `podman exec agentalloy uv run agentalloy reembed` | Re-embed corpus inside the container |
| `podman exec agentalloy uv run agentalloy install-packs --packs all` | Install skill packs inside the container |
| `podman exec agentalloy uv run agentalloy install-packs --packs all --no-restart` | Install packs without restarting the service |

Volume table:

| Volume / Path | Purpose | Persists across restarts? |
|---|---|---|
| `agentalloy-data:/app/data` | LadybugDB index, DuckDB skills database | Yes (named volume) |
| `~/.ollama:/root/.ollama` | Ollama model cache (`qwen3-embedding:0.6b`) and SSH keys | Yes (host bind mount) |

### Health check

The service exposes a health endpoint at:

```bash
curl http://localhost:47950/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status": "healthy", "port": 47950, "corpus_ready": true}
```

The container uses a runtime-generated entrypoint script (`/app/entrypoint.sh`) that handles bootstrap: Ollama installation, model pull, migrations, and pack installation. On subsequent starts, the entrypoint skips all bootstrap steps if `.bootstrap-complete` exists.

### Uninstall — what it removes

`agentalloy uninstall` is the one-shot teardown. The default preset is **full uninstall** — it removes everything:

- **Sentinel-bounded harness blocks** in *every* repo recorded in install-state.json (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, .clinerules, .cursorrules, .cursor/rules/agentalloy.mdc, .opencode/system-prompt.md, .aider.conf.yml, etc.). The cross-repo walk happens before the CLI is removed; pass `--no-all-repos` to limit to cwd. Tampered blocks (sha256 mismatch — the user edited inside the sentinels) are skipped without `--force`.
- **MCP entries** for `agentalloy` from `~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`, the cwd repo's `.cursor/mcp.json`, and `.continuerc.json`. The files are deleted if `agentalloy` was their only entry.
- **Native service unit + companion ollama unit** on Linux (`~/.config/systemd/user/agentalloy.service`, `~/.config/systemd/user/ollama.service`, sanitized `agentalloy.env`). On macOS the launchd plist at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.agentalloy.plist`.
- **Manual-mode agentalloy server** if it's still listening on the configured port (SIGTERM, escalating to SIGKILL after 10s).
- **User-scope state**: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/agentalloy/.env`, `install-state.json`, the entire state directory.
- **Derivable artifacts**: `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/agentalloy/outputs/` (per-step JSON dumps including preflight) and `server.log`.
- **CLI uninstall**: removes the `agentalloy` CLI from `~/.local/bin` (via `uv tool uninstall` or `pipx uninstall` depending on how it was installed).

**Preserved by default**: nothing — the full uninstall preset removes everything, including the corpus DB and pulled models. To keep the corpus and models, choose the **keep-data** preset (`--preset keep-data`), which only removes harness wiring and `.env`.

**Flags**:
- `--remove-data` — explicit no-op (the default full preset already removes data). Kept for backward compatibility.
- `--force` — remove sentinel blocks even when the inner content has been edited.
- `--no-all-repos` — only clean sentinels in cwd (legacy behavior; useful for partial cleanup).
- `--preset keep-data` — keep corpus, models, and services; only remove wiring and `.env`.

**Full wipe one-liner** (for testers ready to reinstall from scratch):
```bash
agentalloy uninstall --remove-data
```
This used to require a manual `rm -rf ~/.local/share/agentalloy` afterwards — no longer.

### Uninstalling the container model

For container deployments (`--deployment container`), `agentalloy uninstall` also handles teardown:

- Stops and removes the `agentalloy` container (`podman rm -f agentalloy` or `docker rm -f agentalloy`)
- Removes the `agentalloy-data` volume (`podman volume rm agentalloy-data` or `docker volume rm agentalloy-data`)
- Removes the `~/.ollama` symlink created during setup
- Cleans up harness wiring and state files (same as native model)

If the user wants to keep their corpus and model cache, use `--preset keep-data` — this preserves the volume and Ollama models while removing wiring and `.env`.

## If you got stuck

If you (the LLM) hit an unexpected state at any step, **stop and tell the user**. Don't improvise around the runbook. The CLI is the source of truth — if it says a step failed, that step failed; don't assume.

Common stuck-states:
- The CLI prints a `WARNING: Found legacy per-repo state at <repo>/.agentalloy/install-state.json`. That's a AgentAlloy install from before the v2 user-scope refactor. Either delete the legacy file or `mv` it to the user-scope location (the warning prints the exact command).
- The CLI exits 3 (schema mismatch). The user has a state file from a different version. Tell them to back it up and re-run install with a fresh state.
- The CLI exits 4 (already-completed). That step ran successfully before. Read the user-scope state file to see what's done; skip ahead. (`agentalloy status` shows this concisely.)
- A required external tool (Ollama, LM Studio) is missing. Tell the user the tool's install URL and wait for them to install it manually. Do NOT auto-execute install scripts.
- A port collision on 47950. Re-run `write-env` with `--port <n>` and re-run `wire-harness` so the harness config gets the new URL.
- **Ollama SSH key missing:** You see the error
  `pull model manifest: open ~/.ollama/id_ed25519: no such file or directory` when
  pulling models. This means your Ollama instance requires SSH key authentication but
  the key file doesn't exist at `~/.ollama/id_ed25519`.
  **Fix:** Generate the key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ollama/id_ed25519 -N ""`,
  then register the public key (`~/.ollama/id_ed25519.pub`) on your Ollama server.
  See the prerequisites section for full details.
- **Container model pull fails with SSH key error (container only):** The container
  starts but the model pull fails inside the container with an SSH key error, even
  though the key exists on the host at `~/.ollama/id_ed25519`. This can happen if the
  `~/.ollama` directory doesn't exist or isn't readable by the container runtime.
  **Fix:** Create the directory and key on the host first:
  `mkdir -p ~/.ollama && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ollama/id_ed25519 -N ""`,
  then restart the container (`podman restart agentalloy` or `docker restart agentalloy`).
  The container re-reads the mounted `~/.ollama` directory on each start.
